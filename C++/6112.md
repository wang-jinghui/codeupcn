问题 C: 6112 Be Unique (20)
-------------------------

题目描述
Being unique is so important to people on Mars that even their lottery is designed in a unique way. The rule of winning is simple: one bets on a number chosen from [1, 104]. The first one who bets on a unique number wins. For example, if there are 7 people betting on 5 31 5 88 67 88 17, then the second one who bets on 31 wins.

输入
Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains a line which begins with a positive integer N (<=105) and then followed by N bets. The numbers are separated by a space.

输出
For each test case, print the winning number in a line. If there is no winner, print "None" instead.

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 100000;
int main() {
    int N;
    while(cin>>N) {
        int nums[N], count[maxn] = {0};
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            cin>>nums[i];
            count[nums[i]]++;
        }
        int find = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (count[nums[i]] == 1) {
                cout<<nums[i]<<endl;
                find = 1;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!find) cout<<"None"<<endl;
    }
